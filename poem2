 In the land of thought, where ideas take flight,
Lived Paweł Nierodka, a beacon so bright.
A philosopher known far and wide,
With a freelance spirit, he couldn't hide.

[singer 2]
A seeker of truth...
His teachings a gift...
In minds they'll quench the thirst...
High aspirations, 
a sigma grindset,
A modern philosopher


[singer 1]
He pondered and laughed at life's absurdities,
A perfect sense of humor was his constant companion, you see.
[singer 2]
In the labyrinth of wisdom, he'd be the jester,
With a wink and a smile, he'd dispel any pressure.

[singer 1]
His classroom, a stage, where ideas were born,
[singer 2]
The students, his audience, caught up in the thought.

[singer 1]
He'd weave tales of logic and reason so sound,
[singer 2]
A philosopher-freelancer, an unstoppable force around.

[break]

[together]
With the pen as his sword...
he'd dismantle the old ways,
Inventing new thoughts...
with his freethinking he'd blaze.

A teacher, a thinker, a jester and more,
Paweł Nierodka, a legend forevermore.

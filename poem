 In the land of thought, where ideas take flight,
Lived Paweł Nierodka, a beacon so bright.
A philosopher known far and wide,
With a freelance spirit, he couldn't hide.

A seeker of truth, with an insatiable thirst,
His teachings a gift, in the minds they'd quench the first.
High aspirations fueled by a sigma grindset,
Determined to prove the conventional wrong, he'd set it.

He pondered and laughed at life's absurdities,
A perfect sense of humor was his constant companion, you see.
In the labyrinth of wisdom, he'd be the jester,
With a wink and a smile, he'd dispel any pressure.

His classroom, a stage, where ideas were born,
The students, his audience, captivated, in turn.
He'd weave tales of logic and reason so sound,
A philosopher-freelancer, an unstoppable, unbound force around.

With the pen as his sword, he'd dismantle the old ways,
Innovating new thoughts, with his freethinking he'd blaze.
A teacher, a thinker, a jester and more,
Paweł Nierodka, a legend forevermore.
